=begin
As Hillstrom [1] proposed, here the starting points used in the optimizations are chosen from a box surrounding the standard starting point.
One can evaluate the performances of the agorithm by counting the number of iterations required to converge to the solution.
For each test function is defined a procedure, its name, its type and its starting points. The functions are defined in alphabetical order.

module Test_fcn
    # this method will test all the functions defined below
    def test
    end
